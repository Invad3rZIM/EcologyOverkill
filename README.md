# EcologyOverkill

WHat is this & why did you write it? 

Great questions! This is a tool I designed to get out of my homework. I graduate university in about 3.5 weeks, but at the moment I'm a part-time student who took Ecology as a science elective. In about 4 hours, my term-project is due. This project required collecting 15 different leaves, identifying them,
then researching their species classification ( Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Species ) and documenting it in a table.

This seemed like a lot of repetitive, boring work, and so naturally I ignored it until the very last day. Instead, I came across a job form for a tech-company that asked for "a sample of your code". Unfortunately for me, most of the code I write is either professionally done (and so I can't freely share it) or it's way too dated. So I decided I would find a mini-project to work on, & write some code using that company's tech stack.

Then I got an idea - this ecology project is a lot of wikipedia lookups, and it's mindnumbing. Maybe I could partially automate my term-project. So I built a simple webcrawler this morning, one that reads from a list of websites (see files/crawllist.txt), sends a GET requests, then parses the body to find all the relevant data. I saved this data to files/filtereddata.txt.

Unfortunately (and perhaps expectedly), I can't make a flawless webcrawler in the course of an hour or 2. 

There are a couple problems

1. Not all the information I need can be found on wikipedia (about 95% of the data got scraped though). In particular, I needed to use a secondary site to get Phylum & Class information about several different species. No worries, though

2. I still need to check over my data, ensuring accuracy. This is a term-project after all, so I need to be thorough. :)

With that in mind, it made sense to write to files/filtereddata.txt

THat document contained my auto-generated code. I left this intact so you can see the end result of my web-crawler. 

files/modifieddata.txt includes changes I made to correct for data that wasn't on the wikipedia pages. The biggest problem was simply I chose wikipedia pages that didn't have all the requisite info. My bad!

Here's an example of filtereddata.txt vs modifieddata.txt

# Autogenerated (filtered)

Kingdom Plantae
Clade Tracheophytes
Clade Angiosperms
Clade Eudicots
Clade Rosids
Order Rosales
Family Rosaceae
Genus Prunus
Subgenus Prunus

# Modified (user-validated)

Kingdom Plantae
Clade Tracheophytes
Clade Angiosperms
Clade Eudicots
Clade Rosids
Order Rosales
Family Rosaceae
Phylum Magnoliophyta
Class Magnoliopsida
Genus Prunus
Subgenus Prunus
Species Prunus cerasifera, cherry plum

As far as I'm concerned, this web-crawler was a success!
